Sublime PICO-8 v2016.6.30

We have changed some post installation methods:

Font installation
=================

To download the font, open the Command Palette in Sublime Text (ctrl+shift+p / cmd+shift+p) and run "PICO-8: Download Font".
Restart Sublime Text and test different font sizes until you find one that goes well with your screen resolution !

Cartridge runner setup
======================

To setup the Cartridge Runner, open the Command Palette in Sublime Text (ctrl+shift+p / cmd+shift+p) and run "PICO-8: Setup PICO-8 Path".
Then enter the path to your PICO-8 executable in the prompt input.

Defaults to:
  Linux:   "/there/is/no/default/in/linux/shrug/pico8"
  OSX:     "/Applications/PICO-8.app/Contents/MacOS/pico8"
  Windows: "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PICO-8\\pico8.exe"

IMPORTANT: Remember using the escape character for the backslash ("\\") instead of a single one ("\") in Windows !!!
